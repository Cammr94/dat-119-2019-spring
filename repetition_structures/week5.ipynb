    "# Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the action driven in Python is done so by loops.  These things tell the program to repeat stuff.  Having a computer repeat a calculation or just keep trying something through a series of values is the power of computing.  We're going to be focused on looping through a set of known values.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're going to use for loops in nearly every Python program that you write for this class. Sometimes these for loops will look really similar, but you'll be using them for very different purposes.  **This is one of the most challenging aspects of the first month of this class.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specific types of this loop\n",
    "\n",
    "While there is a single syntax rule for `for` loop, there are many types.  We're going to start off with the three core patterns.  We'll learn more patterns as we move forward, but all of those are tweaks or expansions off of one of these three core patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several kinds of loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. repeat a task some arbitrary number of times\n",
    "    * your input is the number of times\n",
    "2. unpack some sequence of content and loop over those elements one at a time\n",
    "    * your input is the sequence, python will unpack it for you\n",
    "3. loop over something for the purposes of looking up another thing\n",
    "    * this one is strange, where you provide the sequence of items that represent the lookup key for another item.  These keys may be just numbers counting up, or they may be other kinds of content in a sequence (such as letters or words).\n",
    "4. loop over something to determine its count or sum \n",
    "\n",
    "There three uses will have a very similar syntax and can be difficult to tell the difference between.  For the sake of names, let's call them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a range loop\n",
    "2. an unpacking loop\n",
    "3. a reference loop\n",
    "4. an accumulator loop\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to explore and reinforce our understanding of data types and other stuff as we play with loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you'll need to mix and match these.  For example, the reference loop will often start off life as a range loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core syntax reference \n",
    "\n",
    "What does this for loop look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for iterable_variable in sequence:\n",
    "    do this stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will loop over the `sequence` you provide, unpacking each value into the `iterable_variable`.  This variable will hold an individual value, one at a time, for each loop through.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's give names to all of these things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* declared and opened with a `for` keyword\n",
    "* a sequence that is being iterated over\n",
    "* an iterable variable to hold the variable contents of the sequence during each loop\n",
    "* white space (the tab) that defines where the executable code lives\n",
    "* the code to be executed each loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Some important notes:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* the iterable variable name can be literally any valid variable name and does not need to be declared previously\n",
    "* the colon at the end of the `for` line block is required and indicates that the declaration line is done\n",
    "* the `in` keyword separates the iterable variable name from the sequence\n",
    "* this case has the sequence literal in the declaration line, but could also be a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a sequence?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a good question with a weird answer.  Sequences are data types in Python that internally support sequencing.  That is, you can ask it \"what's next?\" and it can give you an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things aren't sequences.  Such as numbers (`int`s and `float`s).  You can try asking the number 1 \"what's next?\" but it doesn't know.  Are you counting by 1?  Are you counting by -1? Are you counting by .1?  The question is too ambiguous.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some things are sequences.  Let's look at a word:  `\"hello\"`.  If I ask this word \"What's next?\" I'll be told the individual letters, getting one at a time during the loop.  The iterable variable will hold those values in succession.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### A note on the iterable variable\n",
    "\n",
    "You can give this variable any name you want (but following the standard variable name rules), and it doesn't need to exist before.  It will feel strange, that you are typing in this variable to be used that doesn't yet have a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The for loop takes care of it for you.  It will make all the assignment statements for that sequence for you to that variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it will persist after the for loop has completed! \n",
    "\n",
    "More on this as we progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up a for loop\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three steps for setting up a for loop.  We'll be going through all of these in much more detail as we work through examples. This section is just to set up your thought process.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Determine what kind of pattern you'll be executing.  \n",
    "    * This is a thinking stage, where you need to think through what kind of pattern will move your program forward.\n",
    "2.  Identify your sequence.\n",
    "    * Once you know the kind of pattern you want, this will help you determine the kind of sequence.  There are times when the sequence will be very clear to you, and others where you'll be crafting one (for example in a reference loop) to generate the values you need.\n",
    "3.  Give your iterable variable a good name.\n",
    "    * You can technically call it `kitten`, but that isn't helpful.  Think about what it is and try to name it, being sure that you are matching the plural correctly.  For example, if you are working over a sequence of numbers, you might want to call it `num`, or if it's a string you could call it `character`.  \n",
    "    * Be very careful not to repeat any of your previous variable names, as their previous values will be erased for the iterable variable's value.  You may end up blowing away your data and weird things happen.  \n",
    "    * This name must also be different from the sequence's variable name (if it has one), because it might word and end up with really strange results.\n",

    "\n",
    "## accumulators vs. counters\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of loop really focuses on numbers: generating numbers, manipulating their contents, and converting them to suit your needs.  The only math you'll generally be doing is addition and division.    \n",
    "\n",
    "As you are thinking of accumulators and counters, keep them separate in your head.  They look really similar in the code, but their purpose and usage will be very different!  You can have multiple of both inside your program, but commonly you'll have an accumulator to collect up many values, and then a counter to keep track of how many things you have counted.  There is an argument to be made that counters are a special type of accumulator, but I prefer to think of them as siblings rather than parent/child.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question that you need to ask is:  what am I summing here?  Are you counting a series of uniform values?  Or are you counting up a series of different values?  The variability of the values is a big distinction here.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we have a class of 24 students.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**We can count the number of students.**  Each person here counts as \"1\".  This is a uniform value across all entities.  This is the core of a counter pattern.  Inside the loop you'll see that the incrementing value is often hard coded. \n",
    "\n",
    "**We can sum up the total age.** Each person has some age, which may repeat but is variable across everyone in here.  This value must be accessed each time through, and that value is added up to create a final value representing the total number of years old all the students are in this room.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use them together.  If I know a total sum of a property for a set of entities, and the total number of entities, what does that sound like to you?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how we calculate the mean or average value.  So if we've got a loop counting these two things together, we can calculate some summary statistics about it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Can you think of some examples of things you might want to count up versus things you might want to sum up? \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a step back and look at some code for making these things happen.  \n",

    "# Minimal counter\n",

    "A minimal counter will be the easiest to see this mechanism in action.\n",

As you build up more experience, you'll know what you need faster and begin to have a set of patterns that you are the most comfortable with.  As you are getting started, take note of the patterns that make the most sense to you and latch onto those.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with an range loop, because what we need is to make a for loop that can execute some number of times so that we can count how many times that is.  True, we can run a counter in every type of for loop out there, but let's go with a range loop to start with.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### There are 4 steps to a counter\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the 4 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Establish you base variable at the initial state (usually 0)\n",
    "2. Start a for loop for whatever you're repeating\n",
    "3. Do your stuff, whatever you need to do in that loop\n",
    "4. Update your counter, usually by 1.  This is commonly the last thing in your loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference pattern is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "counter = 0 # 1: your counter variable at the initial state\n",
    "\n",
    "for something in sequence: # 2: loop over something!\n",
    "    do stuff # 3: do all the things\n",
    "    counter = 1 + counter # 4: update the counter, replace 1 and/or the operator with whatever you need\n",
    "```\n",
    " \n",
    "You are often having to do more than just update your counter variable, and many times you need that value in the process.  This means that you'll need to increment up your counter as the last thing you do in your loop. There will be exceptions to this, but they are rare.  More generally, all your incrementers should be at the end of your for loop, and the internal order doesn't always matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "This particular example is counting up by 1, but you can always change what that number is or what the operator is.  For example, if you were counting up by 10, you would have 10 in step 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Worked example of a counter\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 1: have a base\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's start adapting things.  We need to start with a base.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 2: have a for loop in there\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're going to add in our for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "for number in range(5):\n",
    "    print(\"hello\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "You see that I haven't changed up the for loop's content, we'll get to that next.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 3: do stuff to get the count that you need in that for loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Very often with counters you won't need to do anything here, because you're just brute force counting by a certain number each time.  But this is when you'd address any decision structures or data extraction methods to get out the value that you need to count by.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "for number in range(5):\n",
    "    # you'd do stuff here\n",
    "    # or maybe you have more counters do do\n",
    "    # either way, all the fun stuff not counter related goes right after the for loop starts\n",
    "    print(\"hello\") # and likely print it out here instead of \"hello\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 4:  increment up your counter\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've got all our pieces in order and we've done our business, we can finally update our counter.  This is the last step because this is ofter the last thing your for loop.  One of the most common problems that I see is when the increment is put at the beginning of the for loop or in the middle of the action, and everything gets weird.  Almost always it will need to be the last line of code within your for loop.\n",

    "Note our use of `base = base + 1` here.  We are updating a variable that already exists (this is why we define a base), and since we want to reuse it and have the value retained even when the for loop resets, we need to a) keep that base on the outside of our for loop and b) reuse the variable name.  So that repetition of the base variable name is purposeful and absolutely necessary.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What would happen if we didn't include the `print()` there at the end?  (nothing would have printed out)\n",
    "\n",
    "What would happen if the `print(base)` was indented inside the for loop? (we would see a print out for it each time).  Would we see count with the base value of 0?  Would we see count with the final value of 5?  Why?\n",

You don't know how big the individual time moments are (like if it snowed heavily at once or if it was a slow trickle), but you do know the end total of how much snow ended up there.  You can also measure the amount incrementally over time, but once something is added in you can't know how big that individual piece is.\n",
