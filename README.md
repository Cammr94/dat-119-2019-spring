# Some of the lessons and files for DAT-119, Python 1, Spring 2019

## The rest of the files, with detailed instructions, are in Blackboard. 

If you're teaching Python and would like access, let me know. If you're one of my students, I did try to give the folders meaningful names... but a direct link from Blackboard is a better entry point for this material than trying to navigate this repository.

I'd like to thank Elizabeth Wickes for use of [her online learning objects](https://github.com/elliewix/IS-452-Fall2018), parts of which are reproduced here.
